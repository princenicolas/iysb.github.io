        <div id="history"><p>Imus Youth Symphonic Band ’83 Inc. was founded on December 23, 1983, by Mr. Abdoncito “DASOY” Constantino. In recent years, they became the first community band from the Philippines to join an international competition, which was the Thailand International Wind Symphony Competition and other members also competed at the National Music Competition for Young Artist (NAMCYA) nationwide where the band also won 1st runner up. 
            The band also envisioned strengthening the musical prowess of their members outside the band. Some of the musicians became members of other groups like the Philippine National Police Band, Philippine Navy Band, Presidential Security Group Band, Philippine Youth Symphonic Band, San Miguel Philharmonic Orchestra,  ABS CBN Philharmonic Orchestra, Manila Symphony Orchestra, Manila Philharmonic Orchestra, Asian  Youth Orchestra, and many more across various regions.</p></div>
